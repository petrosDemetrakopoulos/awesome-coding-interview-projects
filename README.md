A curated list of coding projects assigned by recruiters after an interview for a software development position
Feel free to contribute by keeping the [awesome lists contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/contributing.md).

## Motivation
During the last month, I have been in search of a job in the software development industry.
Almost every recruiter I met during this process, asked me to deliver a coding project (assigned and selected by him) in order to understand the level of understanding and skills I had.

So here is a list to guide and help anyone looking for a job and may want to see some completed interview projects.
